.SH NAME
fuseiso \- FUSE module to mount ISO filesystem images
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fuseiso
[\fBoptions\fR] <\fIISO image\fR> <\fImount point\fR> [\fIFUSE library options\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the \fBfuseiso\fR command.
.PP
\fBfuseiso\fR provides a module to mount ISO filesystem images using FUSE.
.PP
With FUSE it is possible to implement a fully functional filesystem in a
userspace program.
.PP
\fBfuseiso\fR can read ISO, BIN and NRG images containing ISO9660 filesystems.
Along with it, it supports some common extensions, like Joliet, RockRidge and
zisofs.
.PP
It also supports non\-standard images, like CloneCD's IMGs and Alcohol 120%'s
MDFs, as their format looks exactly like BIN images. One major limitation of
BIN images is that \fBfuseiso\fR does not handle CUE files in any way, and
thus can only work with the first track of those images.
.PP
Other formats like CCD and MDS are not supported, since their format is not
public and no one knows it.
