fuseiso (20070708-3.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * debian/patches (Closes: #779047):
    + Add 02-prevent-buffer-overflow.patch. Prevent stack-based buffer overflow
      when concatenating strings to an absolute path name. Prevention is done
      by checking that the result will stay under the maximum path length as given
      by the platforms PATH_MAX constant.
    + Add 03-prevent-integer-overflow.patch. Prevent integer overflow in ZISO
      code. Bail out if a ZF block size > 2^17 is to be read.
